CSS only mobile slide / off canvas menu
=======================================

CSS only slide down (or any direction) menu for mobile with no JS using :target

Good for those rare times when you can't use JS. Use vendor prefixes as necessary.

Used max-height per this thread on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3508605/css-transition-height-0-to-height-auto
